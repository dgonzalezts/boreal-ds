# Icons

Boreal makes it easy to display font icons with consistent styling across your application. Icons support customizable size and color as icon fonts, meanwhile reduced external dependencies and minimizing performance overhead. This helps teams maintain visual consistency and improve UI clarity through meaningful visual interfaces.

## How to use it

1. Implement a link tag to the Boreal Icons stylesheet in your project.

```html
<link
  rel="stylesheet"
  href="https://resources-borealds.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/icons/current/boreal-styles.css"
/>
```

2. Use the `<em>` tag to display the icon with a class attribute that matches the name of the icon you want to use with the `bds-icon-` prefix.

```html
<em class="bds-icon-home"></em>
```

3. Optionally, you can add a `style` attribute to the `<em>` tag to customize the size and color of the icon.

```html
<em class="bds-icon-home" style="font-size: 2rem; color: #000;"></em>
```
